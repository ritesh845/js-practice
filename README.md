2) Splice Method

<!-- What is the difference between == and === operators -->
== is non-strict 
== strict 

The strict operators take the type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

-Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
-Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
-Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value. There are two special cases in this,
    -NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
    -Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
-Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
